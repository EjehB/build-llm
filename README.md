# build-llm
This repository contains the official code for developing, pretraining, and finetuning a GPT-like Large Language Model (LLM). It is the companion code for the book "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)", which walks through the process of creating a transformer-based LLM using practical steps and open-source resources.
